#
# WHY duoctl. `simctl` has no hinge or rotation command, and `simctl io screenshot` needs
# `--display` on the foldable. duoctl (MIT, pinned below) sends Device Hub's private hinge
# and orientation HID event and reads the result back. Touches land on the cover screen
# only, so every screen is reached by relaunching with the DEBUG screenshot mock
# (HERDR_SCREENSHOT_MOCK), never by tapping.
#
# THE HINGE MOVES ONLY A FEW TIMES. Each pose is set once, then the app is relaunched per
# screen. Every hinge change is a sweep (`--duration`): on the iOS 27.1 runtime an instant
# closed<->open jump leaves the simulator unable to switch screens until it is recreated.
# Partial angles keep whichever screen the sweep started on (the simulator switches at the
# ends of the travel), so tent sweeps up from closed (cover stays active) and laptop sweeps
# down from open (inner stays active). That is why the poses run in the order below.
#
# A pose whose hinge/screen does not verify is retried once on a recreated simulator, then
# recorded in FAILURES.txt and skipped. A pose whose interface refuses to rotate (the app
# is portrait-only on iPhone, so the cover screen stays portrait) is captured anyway, with
# the device orientation set directly, and noted in POSES.md rather than FAILURES.txt:
# that is the app's behaviour in the pose, and those images are what the owner sees.
