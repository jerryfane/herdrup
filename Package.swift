// HerdrKit is the transport + protocol layer for the iOS herdr client.
//
// It deliberately contains NO UIKit/SwiftUI so it builds and tests on Linux,
// where it can be exercised against a real herdr server. The iOS target
// consumes it unchanged.
let package = Package(
    name: "HerdrKit",
    // REQUIRED, and its absence was invisible from Linux. With no `platforms`,
    // SwiftPM assumes macOS 10.10 and every modern-concurrency symbol this
    // package is built on becomes unavailable — Task, AsyncThrowingStream,
    // CancellationError, withTaskCancellationHandler, and the rest. Linux does
    // no availability checking at all, so the package compiled there while
    // being unbuildable on any Apple platform.
    //
    // The floors are chosen, not defaults: macOS 14 for the toolchain that runs
    // the tests (Citadel requires .macOS(.v14); a v13 floor fails `swift build`
    // on macOS with a dependency-floor mismatch — invisible on Linux, which
    // ignores `platforms:` entirely), iOS 17 because that is the floor the app
    // target will inherit and it decides which SwiftUI is available to the UI
    // work (and it matches Citadel's iOS floor, which is why iOS already builds).
    // `platforms` constrains Apple platforms only, so the "builds on Linux too"
    // property above is untouched.

        // swift-nio-ssh FORK (Wellz26/swift-nio-ssh), and a fork carrying the

        // revision. Wellz26 0.3.6 (a05e6bbe) killed the app (Mac crash, build 220):
        // a read buffered in the multiplexer was delivered after a child channel had
        // closed locally, servicing it sent a window adjust, and
        // ChildChannelStateMachine.sendChannelWindowAdjust hit preconditionFailure
        // (ChildChannelStateMachine.swift:432, from SSHChildChannel.swift:942 via
        // NIOSSHHandler.channelReadComplete). jerryfane/swift-nio-ssh tag

        // has sent CHANNEL_CLOSE, and the closed states throw instead of crashing as
        // proposed upstream in https://github.com/apple/swift-nio-ssh/pull/239.

        // HOW THE OVERRIDE WORKS: package identity is the URL's last path component,
        // so this root dependency and Citadel's Wellz26 one are the same package
        // `swift-nio-ssh`; the root's location wins, and a `revision:` requirement at
        // the root overrides Citadel's "0.3.4"..<"0.4.0" range. SwiftPM warns that
        // Citadel's dependency "conflicts with dependency on" this URL; that warning
        // is expected. Drop this override once Citadel ships a swift-nio-ssh with
        // the fix, and bump the revision with any Citadel bump.
