/// THE REGRESSION RECEIPT for double-tap word selection.
///
/// WHAT IT DOES AND DOES NOT GUARD, stated first because the previous version of this comment
/// claimed the wrong thing. A review found the repaired behaviour unguarded by a mutant that
/// removes `clearTap.require(toFail: t)` — and a LATER review showed this receipt does not kill
/// that mutant either, for a timing reason neither of us had accounted for: without the failure
/// requirement `clearTap` recognizes at tap-2 touch-up, which is STRICTLY BEFORE SwiftTerm's
/// tripleTap-delayed `doubleTap` selects the word. The clear lands on the pre-tap state, the
/// selection is made ~0.3s later, the highlight paints, and this test passes.
///
/// The same timing implies the mutant is largely BENIGN in production, so the original P1 was a
/// reasoned coin-toss rather than a measured wipe. What this file does guard: no highlight at
/// all, a selection that is active but EMPTY, a selection SwiftTerm holds but does not paint,
/// and a deselection that never reaches the view. Those are real and it has caught three of
/// them. It is not a guard on the require(toFail:) line, and saying so was overclaiming.
///
/// THIS FILE HAS NOW BEEN WRONG FOUR TIMES, always about its own instrument and never about the
/// product code. Each lesson is kept because each was independently discoverable and I missed
/// it:
///
/// 1. PIXELS AGAINST A BASELINE CANNOT TELL A SELECTION FROM A POPOVER. v1 proved persistence
///    by diffing against the pre-selection frame, so ANY on-screen difference satisfied it —
///    including SwiftTerm's context menu merely being present.
/// 2. NEVER READ THE PASTEBOARD IN THIS REPO. v2 asserted on `UIPasteboard.general.string`. A
///    pasteboard READ raises a system paste prompt, nothing answers it in CI, and the run hung
///    to the 45-minute job timeout and was cancelled with no test results at all. The
///    constraint was already written twice in the app, at CopyForAgentButton.swift:9 and
///    HerdrApp.swift:685, both saying the app writes and never reads because that prompt
///    failed App Review under 2.1a.
/// 3. A COPY MENU IS NOT A SELECTION. v3 asserted `menuItems["Copy"].exists`. A reviewer
///    measured SwiftTerm's `selectedTextBackgroundColor` at 0 of 3,162,132 pixels in every
///    frame while Copy WAS present: `selectedColumnsRange` yields an EMPTY range when
///    `startCol == endCol`, so a tap off the glyphs leaves `selection.active == true` with
///    nothing selected and nothing painted, and `canPerformAction` offers Copy anyway.
/// 4. A PIXEL COUNT CANNOT NAME A CAUSE. v4 measured the highlight and reported "teal px=0"
///    twice, which is consistent with four different bugs. I diagnosed it twice from that one
///    number and was wrong both times — first a keyboard-relayout race, then coordinates. So
///    the app now publishes SwiftTerm's own selection state under the mock env var and this
///    reads it, asserting STATE before PIXELS so a failure says which layer broke.
///
/// Two corrections to v4's own claims, both from review: my "these mock lines are short"
/// remark was wrong (they are 68 of 80 columns, so the earlier dx values were over text after
/// all, and the retroactive "past end of line" diagnosis was dubious), and the coordinates were
/// sound throughout. The two-stage focus tap is kept anyway: it removes a real race in which a
/// keyboard-driven resize can clear a just-made selection, which is a hazard on device even
/// when CI happens to win it.

    /// 0x74CEDC. None of them appears in THIS mock — the fixture's blocked agent draws an amber
    /// dot, the cursor is hidden by ESC[?25l, and the seeded text is uncoloured — so the
    /// detector is specific here. What makes that safe is not the constant but the
    /// `baseTeal < 20` premise: a working-status dot would contribute roughly 28 downsampled

    /// the conclusion.

    /// ground (#0B0D1C) at the edge of a glyph lands around g=89, which their threshold would
    /// reject. Relaxing it can only admit more colours, which is why the test asserts the
