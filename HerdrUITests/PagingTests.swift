/// The horizontal swipe-between-agents gesture was REMOVED: a finger/mouse drag meant to SELECT
/// terminal text was triggering it and paging to an unwanted agent. This test is the inverted
/// receipt — it proves the removal held: a fast horizontal flick on the terminal body no longer
/// changes the front pane. (Agent switching now lives entirely in the list/sidebar.)
///
/// Launches the keep-mounted paging harness (`HERDR_SCREENSHOT_MOCK=paging`) — three
/// distinctively-named agents (ALFA / BRAVO / CHARLIE) in the real `PaneKeepAliveContainer`.
/// Only the FRONT pane is hittable (`.accessibilityHidden(!isFront)` + opacity/hit-testing off on
/// the rest), so an existence+hittable assertion genuinely proves which pane is on screen. If a
/// swipe still paged, BRAVO would become the hittable front → this fails. So a PASS proves the
/// swipe recognizers are gone and a horizontal flick leaves the agent unchanged.
