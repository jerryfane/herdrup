/// THE RENDER RECEIPT for the degraded-peer staleness marker.
///
/// The unit tests pin the RULE (`AgentRow.showsUnconfirmedMarker`) but cannot see the
/// view, so a review mutant that disabled the card's condition entirely
/// (`if false && row.showsUnconfirmedMarker`) compiled and survived all 415 runnable
/// HerdrKit tests. That is the gap this file closes: it asserts the marker is actually
/// on screen, so the same mutant fails here instead of shipping green.
///
/// The `list` mock roster carries a federated `mcb-air/mcb-air` row whose live status the
/// daemon blanked to "unknown" after a missed poll, with the real state moved to
/// `last_known_status: "blocked"` and `reachability: "degraded"`. That row escalates into
/// NEEDS YOU on a last-known value, so it is exactly the row that must not read as a
/// confirmed one.
///
/// Asserts on the ACCESSIBILITY IDENTIFIER, not the visible string. The chip overrides its
/// accessibility label with an explanatory sentence for VoiceOver, which means the word
/// "stale" is not findable by label. The first version of this file looked for the label
/// and failed on its first CI run for exactly that reason.
