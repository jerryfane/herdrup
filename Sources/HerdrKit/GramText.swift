/// own monospaced inset with a Copy button.
///
/// The rules, kept deliberately small:
/// - A fence is a line that starts (after optional indentation) with three or more backticks.
///   What follows the backticks is the info string; its first word is the language. An info
///   string holding a backtick is not a fence (CommonMark), so ```` ```inline``` ```` stays prose.
/// - The block closes on a line of only backticks, at least as many as the opening run.
/// - An opening fence that never closes is prose: it and everything after it read as text.
/// - The newline next to a fence belongs to the fence, so `"Run:\n```\nls\n```\nDone"` is
///   `Run:`, `ls`, `Done`. Prose that is only whitespace (between adjacent fences) is dropped.
/// - CRLF line endings read as LF.
