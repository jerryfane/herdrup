///
/// THE ORDER IS THE POINT.
///
///  1. PIN the host key first. If pinning fails, nothing has touched the other machine —
///     no key has been added, nothing needs revoking. Pinning after redeeming would leave
///     an orphaned key in someone's `authorized_keys` on a failure they did not cause.
///  2. REDEEM, which hands over the public key.
///  3. SAVE the host and its private key.
///
/// A host saved without a pin is the failure worth refusing outright: `HostEditor` hosts
/// trust-on-first-use, so an unpinned entry connects to whatever answers, once, silently.
/// The whole reason the payload carries a fingerprint is to close that window.
