/// Every path the README's layout NAMES must exist. It deliberately does not

/// dropped after four rounds of trying to make it correct.
///
/// WHY THIS IS A TEST AND NOT A SCRIPT: I described that block as "generated
/// from `ls`, and the generator fails if a file has no description" — and then
/// committed only its OUTPUT. The generator existed for one invocation in a
/// shell. Review added an undescribed source file, the warnings-as-errors build
/// compiled it, and nothing noticed: the safeguard I had claimed did not exist
/// in the repository at all.
///
/// A guard that lives in someone's terminal history is not a guard. This one
/// runs with `swift test`.
///
/// It checks ONE DIRECTION ONLY: every path the README names must exist. Adding
/// a source file without a README entry does NOT fail — that completeness claim
/// was dropped deliberately, because enforcing it meant maintaining a second,
/// worse copy of the package manifest and would have false-failed the iOS app
/// target. This sentence previously said the opposite, which is the fourth time
/// tonight a comment outlived the guard it described.

    /// THIS IS A DELIBERATE REVERSAL, and worth explaining because the previous

    /// every source file must appear — which meant the guard had to model
    /// SwiftPM's source graph to be correct: nested sources, targets with custom
    /// paths, and more than one Swift target. It could not, and each round found
    /// another way it was wrong. Worse, it would have FALSE-FAILED the moment
    /// the iOS app target lands, which is the next piece of work.
    ///
    /// Review offered this option in round four and I took the harder path. The
    /// README is a guide, not an inventory; making it claim exhaustiveness meant
    /// maintaining a second, worse copy of the package manifest. So the claim is
    /// dropped and the block says so, leaving the one property that is cheap,
    /// true, and useful: A NAME IN THE DOCS POINTS AT SOMETHING REAL. That is
